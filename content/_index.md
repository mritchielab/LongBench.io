# LongBench: Comprehensive Long-Read RNA-seq Benchmarking

LongBench is a comprehensive benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate long-read RNA sequencing technologies. Our dataset includes data from eight lung cancer cell lines with synthetic RNA spike-ins, covering bulk, single-cell, and single-nucleus RNA-seq data from multiple platforms.

## Key Features

- **Multi-platform comparison**: ONT PCR-cDNA, ONT direct RNA, PacBio Kinnex, and Illumina
- **Diverse cell types**: Eight lung cancer cell lines (LUAD, SCLC-A, SCLC-P subtypes)
- **Synthetic controls**: Sequins and Lexogen SIRV-set 4 spike-ins for ground truth analysis
- **Multiple data types**: Bulk, single-cell, and single-nucleus RNA-seq
